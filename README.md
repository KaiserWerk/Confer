# Confer Client

This is the client component of the Confer application. Providing a rudimentary UI, this application,
in conjunction with the Confer Server, allows you to edit configuration files on remote servers.

Cache files are saved to the folder ``%AppData%\ConferServer``.

### Installation

Open the solution (.sln file) in your IDE, e.g. Visual Studio and publish it for your preferred target 
OS/architecture. Place the executable wherever you like it.
